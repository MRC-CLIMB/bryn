Hi {{ user.first_name }}!

The lease for your server '{{ server_name }}' is due to expire in {% if hours_remaining <= 24 %}{{ hours_remaining }} hours{% else %}{{ days_remaining }} days{% endif %} ({{ expiry }}).

If you do not renew your lease, this server may be automatically shelved to free up capacity.

If you are still using this server, you can renew your lease by following the following link:
