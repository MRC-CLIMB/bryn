Dear {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name}},

We are writing because you are using CLIMB-BIG-DATA as a member of '{{ team.name }}', under the responsibility of your Primary User.

Please remind your Primary User to renew their CLIMB-BIG-DATA licence before it expires in {{ time_remaining.days }} days ({{ team.licence_expiry }}).
We have already sent them an email asking to do this.

If we don't hear from the primary user for your group by {{ team.licence_expiry }}, all VMs associated with the group will be shelved.
If we then do not hear from the primary user by {{ termination_date }}, we will terminate all the VMs in the group, including yours.

Please always remember that, by accessing our service, all users are agreeing to the current version of our terms and conditions, which are available to review at {{ licence_terms_url }}

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Kind regards,
{{ licence_email_signatories }}
