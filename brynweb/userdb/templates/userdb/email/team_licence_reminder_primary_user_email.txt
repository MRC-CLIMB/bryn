Dear {{ user.first_name }} {{ user.last_name}},

We are writing because your CLIMB-BIG-DATA Primary User licence for the group '{{ team.name }}' is due for renewal in {{ time_remaining.days }} days ({{ team.licence_expiry }}).
Please renew your licence by logging in at {{ team_management_url }}, and following the instructions under the licence renewal panel.

If you don't renew your licence before {{ team.licence_expiry }}, we will shelve all the VMs associated with your group.
If you then do not renew your licence by {{ termination_date }}, we will terminate all your VMs.

If you fail to renew your licence, you will still be able to apply for a new licence anytime in the future.

Please always remember to terminate your VMs if you have finished using them.

If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to get in touch.

Kind regards,
{{ licence_email_signatories }}
